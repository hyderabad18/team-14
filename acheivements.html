  <h3>Eswaramma | cashier At Hypercity</h3>
  <p>
  
    Eshwaramma sits across me with her arms folded across her lap, a shy smile on her face. She comes from Nellore, the second of two daughters, born with a locomotive disability. She studied in a normal school like her sister, and her face lights up and words leave her mouth more rapidly when she talks about her school, her friends, and her favorite subject - Math.

<h3>G. Parvathi | Works In Max, Lifestyle</h3>
<p>
Parvathi walked into the room with a huge smile pasted on her face, she folded her hands and bowed her head and managed a gentle Namaste before we could begin. I was left alone with her for sometime and in those few moments of silence we held one of the most amazing conversations I have had in a really long time. It was she who held the patience to let me understand how her name was spelled in the sign language. I can never forget that experience and I can never forget the delight that is Parvathi.

  <h3>Srinivas | LifeStyle, Begumpet </h3>
<p>
To a total stranger, Srinivas comes across as a normal 21-year old guy oozing confidence as he smiles. It’s only when you come closer to take a look at the ‘I understand only sign language’ badge that’s pinned to his shirt-pocket, you realize that he is speech-and-hearing impaired. But he manages to communicate more using his sign-language and facial countenances, as we sat down for our little chat.

<h3>B.Raju | LifeStyle, Begumpet</h3>
<p>
With very limited options in his hometown - Rajamundry - Raju, decided to stay away from his family for the sake of pursuing his studies. Having completed schooling until 10th in Kakinada, he moved to Vijayawada to complete his Junior college education as well. Thanks to the Govt. sponsor, his family was not burdened too much for his education.

Staying away from his big family - 2 elder brothers, 2 elder sisters, Mother & Father, all involved in Agriculture - Raju realized, at a very young age, that his speech-and-hearing disability should, in no way, hinder his pursuit of education. He is now employed at the Begumpet branch of LifeStyle - de-tagging the clothes and working behind the counter.
